# Introduction to Information and Technology Literacy

**LIB105, section WB1**

Class meets online, June 10 - July 12, 2013

*Instructor*: Mr. Joshua Beatty (call me Joshua)

*Phone*: (518) 564–5200 (work hours only)

*Email*: jbeat003@plattsburgh.edu

## “Information and technology literacy”? What does that mean?

Someone who is literate in information and technology…

-   Conducts research well and efficiently.
-   Can channel the flow of information to eliminate irrelevant data.
-   Knows how to use the core technologies of today’s campus and
    business worlds.
-   Understands how these technologies shape and are shaped by society.

At its core, this course is about managing the flow of information that
threatens to overwhelm us when we are doing research.

Try a Google search on your favorite singer or actor or athlete. How
many results do you get? Out of those millions of results, how would you
go about finding the sources that are best – most informative, most
reliable?

Over the next month you’ll practice a research process that will help
solve that problem.

## Contacting me

I’m in and out of my office all day, but am always near a computer. So
it’s much easier to get in touch with me via email
(jbeat003@plattsburgh.edu) than by phone. I’ll respond to your emails
within 24 hours, and probably more quickly. If you don’t get an
immediate response *don’t panic*! I do sleep on occasion.

## Course materials

There is no textbook required for this course. You will, however, need
access to a computer with an internet connection, a browser, and
Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.

All materials for the course can be found here on Moodle.

## Structure of the course

This class is broken into eight lessons. You’ll complete two lessons
each week for the first four weeks of the class. During the fifth week
you’ll complete a final project.

Each lesson will consist of three components:

1.  You will have a short **quiz** to complete. The quiz will be
    multiple-choice and you may take it as many times as you like.
    **Only the highest grade will count**. The rest of the lesson will
    expand on what you do in the quiz.

2.  You’ll work through some content (think of this as equivalent to a
    lecture or textbook). This might consist of reading through a web
    page or watching a video.

3.  Finally, you’ll complete an assignment using the skills you picked
    up from the quiz and the reading or video. This will require you to
    do a small amount of research in a physical library or on our
    website. You’ll submit your assignment to the dropbox on Moodle.
    Assignments will be graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.
    If you receive an unsatisfactory mark, you may revise your
    assignment after talking with me about what you got wrong. **Only
    the grade from the revised assignment will count**.

## Grading

### Components

*Twice-weekly assignments*: 40% (divided among 7 assignments)

*Twice-weekly quizzes*: 20%

*Final project*: 40%

Failure to complete an assignment, the midterm project, or the final
project will result in a grade of **zero** for that portion of the
course.
