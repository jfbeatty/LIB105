of information. A professor may request **primary**, **secondary**, or
**tertiary** sources. What does that mean? This guide explains these
terms and gives examples for each category.

## Primary Sources

**Definition:**

Primary sources are original materials. They are from the time period
involved and have not been filtered through interpretation or
evaluation. Primary sources are original materials on which other
research is based. They are usually the first formal appearance of
results in physical, print or electronic format. They present original
thinking, report a discovery, or share new information.

**Note:** The definition of a primary source may vary depending upon the
discipline or context.

**Examples include:**

-   Artifacts (e.g. coins, plant specimens, fossils, furniture, tools,
    clothing, all from the time under study)
-   Audio recordings (e.g. radio programs)
-   Diaries
-   Internet communications on email, listservs
-   Interviews (e.g., oral histories, telephone, e-mail)
-   Journal articles published in peer-reviewed publications
-   Letters
-   Newspaper articles written at the time
-   Original Documents (i.e. birth certificate, will, marriage license,
    trial transcript)
-   Patents
-   Photographs
-   Proceedings of Meetings, conferences and symposia
-   Records of organizations, government agencies (e.g. annual report,
    treaty, constitution, government document)
-   Speeches
-   Survey Research (e.g., market surveys, public opinion polls)
-   Video recordings (e.g. television programs)
-   Works of art, architecture, literature, and music (e.g., paintings,
    sculptures, musical scores, buildings, novels, poems)
-   Web sites

## Secondary Sources

**Definition:**

Secondary sources are less easily defined than primary sources.
Generally, they are accounts written after the fact with the benefit of
hindsight. They are interpretations and evaluations of primary sources.
Secondary sources are not evidence, but rather commentary on and
discussion of evidence. However, what some define as a secondary source,
others define as a tertiary source. Context is everything.

**Note:** The definition of a secondary source may vary depending upon
the discipline or context.

**Examples include:**

-   Bibliographies (also considered tertiary)
-   Biographical works
-   Commentaries, criticisms
-   Dictionaries, Encyclopedias (also considered tertiary)
-   Histories
-   Journal articles (depending on the discipline can be primary)
-   Magazine and newspaper articles (this distinction varies by
    discipline)
-   Monographs, other than fiction and autobiography
-   Textbooks (also considered tertiary)
-   Web site (also considered primary)

collection of primary and secondary sources.

-   Dictionaries and Encyclopedias (also considered secondary)
-   Directories
